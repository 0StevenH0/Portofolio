                <p>
                    In the realm of deep learning and artificial intelligence, the robustness and security of machine
                    learning models are paramount. Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to the reliability and
                    integrity of these models. They can lead to misleading results, compromise system security, and
                    erode trust in AI technologies.

                    At first, i created adversarial image generators to handle adversarial attacks, my original approach
                    was to train a trained model with adversarial attacked image, however doing so significantly lower
                    model`s ability in handling normal image, later on i tried to train a layer with capabilities to handle
                    both noise and normal image, this can be achieved by trying to mimic conv layer result of original conv
                    layer trained on normal image, and a new layer trained on noised image, however this approach also
                    led to similar problems and result worse than the first approach.

                    The importance of mapping the human vasculature, particularly the microvasculature, lies in its fundamental role in ensuring the proper functioning of our body's organs and tissues. This task involves understanding the intricate interactions, spatial organization, and specialization of the approximately 37 trillion cells that make up the human body.
                Source : <a onclick="window.open('https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hubmap-hacking-the-human-vasculature')">Kaggle</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I leveraged the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, a widely recognized object detection model, and customized it to suit the unique requirements of microvascular structure segmentation.
                    Then later on mask the result using coco masking
                </p>
                <p>
                    in training the model, i'm using similar approach to that of YOLO paper, i first crop and resized the original image and their region, later on i train it on a classification model to predict whether the cropped part has blood vessel or not, after that i use the weight of all conv layer from classification model, and modify it to that of YOLO architecture.

                    The Gene Ontology (GO) serves as a hierarchical framework for elucidating the biological functions of genes and gene products, offering insights at varying levels of abstraction (Ashburner et al., 2000). It provides a robust model for comprehending the multifaceted nature of protein functionality.

In practical terms, the GO leverages experimentally established term-protein assignments as class labels for individual proteins. In essence, when a protein is associated with a specific term, it signifies that rigorous experimental evidence validates its role in carrying out that particular function. Through the systematic processing of these annotated terms, a valuable dataset emerges, encapsulating proteins and their empirically verified functional attributes for each term. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for further research and exploration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I applied the TAPE (The Annotated Transformer for Protein Structure Prediction) library to develop a robust multi-class classification model. Leveraging TAPE's pre-trained transformer models, particularly BERT, I harnessed their power to encode and analyze protein sequences effectively.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    As the Tape's embedding dimension are too large being (512 / 768) in dimension, i crafted my own generator, using sparse matrix and using top-n approach to optimize my memory usage.

                <p>Web scraping is a vital technique in the realm of data acquisition and analysis. It enables the
                    extraction of valuable data from websites, allowing for comprehensive research, analysis, and
                    insights. </p>
                <p>I crafted a data extraction pipeline that navigated IMDB's web pages, accessing details such as movie
                    titles, directors, casting, and writer information and later on convert this to csv. This pipeline ensured the systematic and
                    efficient collection of a wide range of movie data.

                    My solution was designed to gather movie-related data, providing a rich dataset for subsequent
                    research and analysis. This included information crucial for assessing movie trends, analyzing
                    ratings, and studying the evolution of cast members in various films.
